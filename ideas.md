# Ideas

This is a document that will contain descriptions of ideas for future scripts
that I may or may not end up creating for mybin.

## maspec

This script when run on a particular machine will give you specs for that
machine such as the operating system, hardware information, and other
information that will be nice to have when trying to quickly get a run
down of your machine.

A particular use case that I have in mind for this script is to allow a
person to quickly summarize the specs of a machine they are running code
on when they are posting a question about that code to a forum like
[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com).

## gentex

This script will take an outline written in
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
and generate a set of LaTeX files matching that outline. This will
speed up the process of getting a paper started. You can quickly
outline a paper and see how it looks using Markdown and then quickly
move to the LaTeX format when you are ready.
