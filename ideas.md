Ideas
=====

This is a document that will contain descriptions of ideas for future scripts
that I may or may not end up creating for mybin.

This script when run on a particular machine will give you specs for that
machine such as the operating system, hardware information, and other
information that will be nice to have when trying to quickly get a run
down of your machine.

A particular use case that I have in mind for this script is to allow a
person to quickly summarize the specs of a machine they are running code
on when they are posting a question about that code to a forum like
[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com).
